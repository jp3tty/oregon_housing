OREGON HOUSING STUDY - PROJECT SYNOPSIS
=======================================

Project Overview
----------------
This study aims to analyze homeless populations, housing costs, average income levels, 
and housing surplus across all 36 Oregon counties. The project will be showcased on 
Tableau Public to demonstrate data science capabilities.

Study Scope
-----------
- Geographic Coverage: All 36 Oregon counties
- Time Period: 1990-2023 (historical data collection)
- Key Metrics: Population, housing costs, income levels, housing surplus measures
- Data Sources: Multiple federal and state databases

Data Collection Strategy
------------------------
Phase 1: Homeless Population Data Collection
- File: homeless_data_collector.py
- Decennial Census: 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020
- ACS Estimates: 2005-2023 (annual)
- Coverage: All 36 Oregon counties
- Output: CSV with comprehensive metadata
- Note: "homeless_" prefix indicates this is total population data used to calculate homeless gaps

Phase 2: Housed Data Collection
- File: housed_data_collector.py
- ACS Estimates: 2010-2023 (annual)
- Coverage: All 36 Oregon counties
- Data includes: housed units, tenure, vacancy, rent, home values
- Output: Comprehensive housed metrics CSV
- Note: "housed_" prefix indicates this is housing data used to calculate homeless gaps

Data Structure
--------------
Homeless Population Data Columns:
- year: Data collection year
- county_fips: County FIPS code
- county_name: County name
- homeless_total_population: Total population count (used to calculate homeless gaps)
- data_source: "Decennial Census" or "ACS Estimate"
- margin_of_error: Available for ACS, NaN for decennial
- last_updated: Timestamp of data collection

Housed Data Columns:
- year: Data collection year
- county_fips: County FIPS code
- county_name: County name
- housed_total_housing_units: Total housing units available
- housed_total_occupied_units: Total occupied housing units
- housed_owner_occupied_units: Owner-occupied housing units
- housed_renter_occupied_units: Renter-occupied housing units
- housed_population: Total housed population (owner + renter)
- housed_total_vacant_units: Total vacant housing units
- housed_vacant_for_rent: Vacant units available for rent
- housed_vacant_for_sale: Vacant units available for sale
- housed_vacant_seasonal: Seasonal/vacation units
- housed_vacant_migrant: Migrant worker units
- housed_vacant_other: Other vacant units
- housed_median_gross_rent: Median monthly rent
- housed_median_home_value: Median home value
- housed_vacancy_rate_percent: Vacancy rate percentage
- housed_homeownership_rate_percent: Homeownership rate percentage
- housed_rental_rate_percent: Rental rate percentage
- data_source: "ACS Estimate"
- last_updated: Timestamp of data collection

Data Quality Approach
---------------------
- No filtering of potentially unreliable data
- Keep all data including quality issues for analysis
- Comprehensive logging of data collection process
- Handle missing data as NaN values
- Retry logic for API failures (3 attempts)

Technical Implementation
-----------------------
- Python-based data collection
- Census API integration
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- CSV output format for Tableau compatibility
- Timestamped log files for debugging
- Organized directory structure:
  - Data_Collection_Output/ (main output directory)
    - historic_data/ (timestamped files and logs)
      - collection_logs/ (detailed execution logs)
      - *_timestamp.csv (versioned data files)
    - *.csv (current data files, overwritten each run)

Future Phases (Planned)
-----------------------
Phase 3: Income Level Data
- Median household income
- Poverty rates
- Income distribution

Phase 4: Homeless Gap Analysis
- Calculate homeless gaps: homeless_total_population - housed_population
- Analyze housing surplus vs. population needs
- County-level homeless gap trends

Data Sources Identified
-----------------------
1. HUD Point-in-Time (PIT) Count Data (2007-present)
2. American Community Survey (ACS) - 2005-present
3. Decennial Census - 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020
4. Multnomah County Homeless Services Data
5. Portland Housing Bureau Open Data
6. Oregon Housing and Community Services

Collection Date: August 11, 2024
Status: Phase 1 & 2 Implementation Complete
Next Steps: Execute both data collectors, then proceed to Phase 3

Notes
-----
- All data sources are publicly accessible
- No API keys required for initial data collection
- Comprehensive logging implemented for debugging and transparency
- Data structure designed for easy Tableau integration
- Focus on historical trends and comprehensive county coverage
- "homeless_" prefix in population data indicates this is used to calculate homeless gaps
- "housed_" prefix in housing data indicates this is used to calculate homeless gaps
- Clear file naming: homeless_data_collector.py and housed_data_collector.py
- Perfect for homeless gap analysis: homeless_total_population - housed_population
