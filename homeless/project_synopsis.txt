OREGON HOUSING STUDY - PROJECT SYNOPSIS
=======================================

Project Overview
----------------
This study aims to analyze homeless populations, housing costs, average income levels, 
and housing surplus across all 36 Oregon counties. The project will be showcased on 
Tableau Public to demonstrate data science capabilities.

Study Scope
-----------
- Geographic Coverage: All 36 Oregon counties
- Time Period: 2009-2023 (data collection based on API availability)
- Key Metrics: Population, housing costs, income levels, housing surplus measures
- Data Sources: Multiple federal and state databases

Data Collection Strategy
------------------------
Phase 1: Population Data Collection âœ… COMPLETED
- File: population_collector.py (renamed from homeless_data_collector.py)
- Decennial Census: 2020 (only year available via modern API)
- ACS Estimates: 2009-2023 (annual, including 2020 for comparison)
- Coverage: All 36 Oregon counties
- Output: CSV with comprehensive metadata and data quality scoring
- Note: Clear naming convention - "total_population" (not confusing "homeless_" prefix)
- Status: Successfully collecting 576 records (36 counties Ã— 16 year-sources)

Phase 2: Housing Supply Data Collection âœ… COMPLETED
- File: housing_supply_collector.py (renamed from housed_data_collector.py)
- ACS Estimates: 2009-2023 (annual, matching population data timeframe)
- Coverage: All 36 Oregon counties
- Data includes: housing units, tenure, vacancy, rent, home values, construction permits
- Output: Comprehensive housing supply metrics CSV with data quality assessment
- Note: Clear naming convention - "housing_supply_*" (not confusing "housed_" prefix)
- Status: Successfully implemented with 25+ housing variables and comprehensive data quality framework

Data Quality Approach âœ… IMPLEMENTED
---------------------
- Comprehensive data quality framework with scoring (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor)
- Multi-dimensional assessment: completeness, accuracy, timeliness, consistency
- Professional data validation and logical consistency checks
- Comprehensive logging of data collection process with performance metrics
- Handle missing data as NaN values with quality scoring
- Retry logic for API failures (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Data lineage tracking and source quality assessment

Technical Implementation âœ… PRODUCTION-READY
-----------------------
- Python-based data collection with async support
- Census API integration with comprehensive error handling
- Professional data architecture with clear schemas and validation
- Comprehensive error handling, logging, and performance monitoring
- CSV output format for Tableau compatibility
- Timestamped log files for debugging and audit trails
- Organized directory structure:
  - Data_Collection_Output/ (main output directory)
    - historic_data/ (timestamped files and logs)
      - collection_logs/ (detailed execution logs)
      - collection_metrics/ (performance and quality metrics)
      - *_timestamp.csv (versioned data files)
    - *.csv (current data files, overwritten each run)
- GitHub repository with version control and documentation

Current Development Status
-------------------------
Phase 1: Population Data Collection âœ… COMPLETED
Phase 2: Housing Supply Data Collection âœ… COMPLETED
Phase 3: Income Level Data ðŸ”„ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
Phase 4: Housing Gap Analysis ðŸ”„ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
Phase 5: Advanced Analytics ðŸ”„ PLANNED

Future Phases (Planned)
-----------------------
Phase 3: Income Level Data ðŸ”„ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
- Median household income
- Poverty rates
- Income distribution
- Affordability metrics and cost burden analysis

Phase 4: Housing Gap Analysis ðŸ”„ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
- Calculate housing gaps: total_population vs. housing supply
- Analyze housing surplus vs. population needs
- County-level housing gap trends
- Multi-dimensional gap analysis (supply, affordability, quality, homeless)

Phase 5: Advanced Analytics ðŸ”„ PLANNED
- Housing stress scoring (0-100 composite index)
- Affordability index calculations
- Trend analysis and forecasting
- Comparative analysis across counties

Data Sources Identified
-----------------------
1. American Community Survey (ACS) - 2009-2023 âœ… IMPLEMENTED
